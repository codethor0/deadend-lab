This project is a **research and CTF (Capture The Flag) harness** for studying Dead-End Encryption (DEE) and StegoPQ handshake patterns. It is **NOT intended for production use**.

**Supported scope:**
- SAFE and NAIVE mode lab demonstrations
- Attack harness and demo commands
- Deterministic vector generation for testing

**Out of scope:**
- Production cryptographic implementations
- Secure key management
- Compliance with FIPS or other certification requirements

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in this research harness:

1. **For research/CTF issues:** Open a GitHub Issue in this repository.
2. **For sensitive disclosures:** Contact the maintainers privately (see README maintainers section) if the finding could affect other research tooling or documentation.

We do not offer bug bounties. This is a learning and research project.
